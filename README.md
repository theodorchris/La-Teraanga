 # La Teraanga

 La Teraanga is a family food-truck that operates in Worcestershire county and speciliased in Mediterranean cuisine. The greater area of Worcestershire hasn't enough options of Mediterranean restaurants so by moving from town to town can offer something different to the people of each town.

# Testing

  * I tested that this page works with chrome, opera and safari
  * I tested the responsiveness on smaller screen sizes through google tools and it works
  * I have checked that the form works, however since it is a study project i haven't give an action or method. 


# Validation 
 * All the code has been run through the [W3C html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Minor errors were found on the home and contact pages. After a fix and retest, no errors were returned for both. 

  
The HTML validator results for each page are below:

# Accessibility
 * There was an issue with performance on the home page due to large image, i redownload a smaller version and worked much better. The colors and the fonts chosen to be easy readable and make the navigation for the user easier.
 (The image below was taken from a mobile device as at the time google chrome was not respondind)
